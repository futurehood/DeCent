## Introduction

<blockquote>Fuck the Babylon,<br>who's trying to see what I'm on</blockquote>

<img src="readme/1tru-badge.svg" align="right" style="width: 160px;">

This repository serves as a portal to the One True Internet, Web420.

Web420 combines the spirit of Internets of old with modern tech to provide the Good people with the One True Internet they deserve.

DeCent is a collection of protocols and tools that, when forces combine, hold the power to flip the traditional infrastructure of the Internet on its head, putting the power of connectivity back into the hands of the people.

**Project website**: https://futurehood.github.com/DeCent/

## Overview

DeCent is comprised of the following sub-projects:

<ul>
    <li>
        <a href="https://github.com/futurehood/DCNT">DCNT Protocol</a>
    </li>
    <li>
        <a href="https://github.com/futurehood/DeCent-Core">DeCent-Core (DCNT server)</a>    
    </li>
    <li>
        <a href="https://github.com/futurehood/DWA">DWA (Decentralized Web Application) Spec</a>
    </li>
</ul>

In addition to the core projects that are DeCent, official implementations of DWAs are available as well:

<ul>
    <li>
        <span>DeCent Messenger - <a href="https://futurehood.github.io/DeCent-Messenger">Live Demo</a> / <a href="https://github.com/futurehood/DeCent-Messenger">Repository</a></span>
    </li>
</ul>

## Features

The peer-to-peer networks that Web420 is made up of share these features:

1. **Undetectable** - DCNT networks are ephemeral and emergent, the traffic they generate is difficult to identify by pattern. Between that and the fact that every connection is wrapped in browser-based encryption, there is little chance of identifying DCNT users at all.
2. **Unblockable** - Because DCNT networks are undetectable, they are also unblockable. DCNT networks operate over the regular Internet, and appear as normal Internet traffic, making it impossible to block specific DCNT networks without crippling specific, commonly-used capabilities across the whole network.
3. **Unsurveillable** - In addition to being undetectable, every DCNT connection is secured by the SSL/TLS capabilities of the browser that it's running in, using modern, industry-standard security practices. Users can expect connections between DWAs to be secure and completely private.
4. **Uncensorable** - Transmissions over DCNT networks cannot be censored.
5. **Uncorruptible** - DCNT networks and the data passing between them cannot be tampered with or manipulated by anyone outside the network.

## Technical Overview

A DCNT server is a lightweight, self-hosted, HTTPS/WSS server that implements the DCNT protocol. Preferably, this server will be running locally. DWAs connect to DCNT servers to facilitate WebRTC peer-to-peer connections between browsers. Everything that happens within a DWA will occur over the established P2P networks the application creates, there is no dependence on external resources or services.

## Get Started

To access Web420, there are two requirements:

1. A DCNT server, like DeCent-Core
2. A DWA to use with it, like DeCent-Messenger
